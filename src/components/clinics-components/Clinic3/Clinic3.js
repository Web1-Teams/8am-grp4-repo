        <h2>Meditation & Mindfulness: A Guide to Inner Peace and Clarity</h2>
        <b>What is Meditation?</b><br/>
        Meditation is a mental practice where an individual uses techniques like focusing on<br/>
         a particular object, thought, or activity to train attention and awareness,<br/>
         achieving a mentally clear and emotionally calm state.
        <br/>
       <b>What is Mindfulness?</b> <br/>   
      Mindfulness is the practice of being fully present in the moment, <br/> 
      aware of where you are and what you're doing, without being <br/> 
      overly reactive or overwhelmed by what's happening around you.

        <h2>Art Therapy</h2>
        <p className="ArtTherapy">
          Art Therapy is a form of expressive therapy that uses creative processes such as drawing, coloring,
          <br />
          sculpting, or collage-making to help individuals explore and express their emotions,
          <br />
          improve mental health, and gain personal insights. It is not about artistic skills
          <br />
          but about self-expression and the healing journey.

      <h2>How Sleep Affects Mental Health</h2>
      <section className="sleepMentalHealth">
        <h3>Emotional Regulation</h3>
        <p>
          Adequate sleep helps maintain emotional balance. Sleep deprivation can heighten emotional reactivity, making it harder to cope with stress or conflict.
        </p>

        <h3>Cognitive Function</h3>
        <p>
          Sleep plays a critical role in decision-making, problem-solving, and concentration. Chronic sleep deprivation impairs these functions, leading to forgetfulness, confusion, or difficulty focusing.
        </p>

        <h3>Mental Health Disorders</h3>
        
        <p>
          Insomnia and poor sleep quality are often linked to anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder. In some cases, sleep disturbances can be both a symptom and a cause of these conditions.
        </p>

        <h3>Signs of Poor Sleep Hygiene</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep.</li>
          <li>Feeling tired despite getting enough hours of sleep.</li>
          <li>Relying on naps or stimulants like caffeine to stay awake.</li>
          <li>Experiencing disrupted or restless sleep due to stress or physical discomfort.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Physical and Emotional Benefits of Quality Sleep</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Stress Reduction:</b> Restful sleep lowers cortisol levels, reducing stress.</li>
          <li><b>Improved Mood:</b> Adequate sleep fosters positivity and resilience.</li>
          <li><b>Strengthened Relationships:</b> Better emotional regulation reduces conflict.</li>
          <li><b>Enhanced Physical Health:</b> Sleep supports immune function and cardiovascular health.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Creating Better Sleep Habits</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Consistency is Key:</b> Sleep and wake at the same time daily.</li>
          <li><b>Relax Before Bed:</b> Develop a calming bedtime routine.</li>
          <li><b>Limit Stimuli:</b> Avoid screens and loud noises before bedtime.</li>
          <li><b>Optimize Environment:</b> Keep your room cool, dark, and quiet.</li>
          <li><b>Avoid Sleep Disruptors:</b> Limit caffeine and alcohol before bed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>When to Seek Professional Help</h3>
        <p>
          If sleep disturbances persist, consult a healthcare professional. Conditions like insomnia, sleep apnea, and chronic stress may require specialized treatments such as cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I).
