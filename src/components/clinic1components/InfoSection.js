      <h2>Why Choose Physical Therapy?</h2>
      <p>
        Physical therapy provides a comprehensive and patient-centered approach to improving health and recovery. It focuses on addressing the root causes of health issues rather than just masking symptoms. With personalized care, physical therapy aims to enhance mobility, reduce pain, and improve overall well-being for individuals of all ages.
